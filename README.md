# Ray Tracer

IMPORTANT: This is not a production-level raytracer, it was just a project to learn more about ray tracing, path tracing, etc..

## Features:
- Realtime rendering without the need for accumulation
- Specular, metallic, and roughness are all calculated
- Gamma correct lighting
- No unrealistic 100% hard shadows

## Screenshots:
These screenshots are each being rendered in realtime at ~80fps
